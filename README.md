 <h3>Hello, I’m @akio-orestes ⭐</h3>
 
 Design is all about connection: with people, diverse cultures, places, and worlds. Understanding is what I do most every day—overcoming barriers, researching accessible ways to communicate ideas, and developing 
 solutions to everyday problems. I am a front-end designer based in São Paulo, currently working at one of the largest educational institutions in Brazil. Before, I worked in the tech field and have been 
 freelancing since high school. <br><br>
 Currently learning: <em> HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap </em>⭐
